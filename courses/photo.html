             <h1>PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
             <a href="../faculty/owais.html"><h4>By: Photographer Owais</h4></a>
             <p>Becoming a skilled photographer involves a combination of technical knowledge,<br> creativity, and practice. Whether you're interested in capturing moments at a wedding, <br>shooting products for a business, or expressing yourself through fine art photography,<br> understanding your camera, mastering lighting, and learning how to compose a great <br>image are key components of success.
            </p>
            <p class="para">A photography course introduces the basics of capturing high-quality images using <br> various camera types. Students learn about camera settings, such as aperture, shutter <br> speed, and ISO, to control exposure. The course covers composition techniques like <br>the rule of thirds and leading lines to enhance visual storytelling. Students explore <br> different types of photography, including portrait, landscape, and still life. Lighting <br>techniques, both natural and artificial, are taught to achieve the desired mood in photos. <br>Editing software, such as Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, is often included for post- <br>processing skills. The course also covers the use of lenses and filters to achieve different <br>effects. Practical assignments encourage students to experiment with their newfound skills. <br>Students receive feedback to refine their technique and style. By the end, participants gain <br>the ability to capture compelling, professional-quality images.</p>
