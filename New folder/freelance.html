            <h1>FREE LANCING</h1>
           <a href="../faculty/orhan.html"> <h4>By: Prof Orhan</h4></a>
            <p>Freelancing can be an incredibly rewarding career path, offering freedom, flexibility, and <br> the potential for great financial rewards. However, it requires discipline, persistence, and <br> a proactive approach to building a sustainable business.
            </p>
            <p>Freelancing is a form of self-employment where individuals offer their services to clients <br>on a project-by-project basis rather than working for a single employer. Freelancers typically  <br>have more flexibility in choosing their hours, work location, and the clients they collaborate <br>  with. Common freelance fields include writing, graphic design, web development, marketing, <br> and consulting. It allows individuals to be their >own boss, set their rates, and manage their <br> workload. However, freelancers are responsible for finding clients, handling contracts, and <br> managing their finances, including taxes. The gig economy has made freelancing more popular,  <br>with many using online platforms like Upwork and Fiverr to connect with clients. While  <br>freelancing offers independence, it also comes with the challenge of uncertain income and <br> job stability. Successful freelancers often build strong portfolios and networks to attract repeat <br> clients. It can provide a good work-life balance if managed effectively, though it requires self-discipline <br>and time management skills. Freelancing has become an attractive career option for many seeking <br> autonomy and diverse opportunities.</p>
