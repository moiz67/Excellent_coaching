            <h1>SKETCHING</h1>
            <h4>By: Sketcher Aishay</h4>
            <p>Being a sketch artist is not just about drawing; itâ€™s about observing the world <br>around you and translating that observation into art. Whether you sketch for <br>personal enjoyment, as a professional artist, or as part of a creative process in <br>fields like concept art or illustration, mastering sketching takes time, practice, <br>and a deep understanding of technique and composition.
            </p>
            <p>A sketching course teaches the foundational techniques for drawing and illustration. <br>Students learn about different types of pencils, charcoal, and other sketching materials. <br>The course covers basic shapes and forms, helping students build the ability to draw <br>from observation. Proportions, perspective, and depth are emphasized to create realistic <br> sketches. Light and shadow techniques are introduced to add dimension and contrast <br> to drawings. Students practice sketching both still life and live models to hone their <br> skills. The course often includes studies in gesture drawing, enhancing the fluidity of <br>sketches. Different styles, such as realism or abstract sketching, are explored Feedback <br>from instructors helps refine students' drawing techniques. By the end of the course, <br>students gain confidence in sketching and can create detailed, expressive drawings.</p>
